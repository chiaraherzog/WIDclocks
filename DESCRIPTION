Description: This package uses Illumina EPIC or 450k Array data
    to calculate the WID general, epithelial or immune clock in R. It depends on EpiDISH to infer
    the immune composition of the sample. It also enables calculation of the WID-relative-epithelial-age
    and WID-relative-immune-age.
